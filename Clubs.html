              <h2>Club 666 (Three Sixes)</h2>
              <p>
                Club Three 666 (Club 666 or Club Three Sixes), originally named Dance Paradise, was opened by Andrew Sneed in 1942. Sneed hosted distinguished entertainers, such as pantomimist Johnny Hudgins (Black Bottom Digital Archive). The venue once catered an event for the Tuskegee Airmen, and held other events that connected the community and other clubs in the neighborhood. The Club closed for business in 1949 (Peters, 2020, p. 32).

            <h2>Paradise Theater</h2>
            <p>
              The Paradise Theater venue building was constructed in 1919 as the home for the Detroit Symphony Orchestra (DSO). After the DSO relocated to Orchestra Hall, the venue was reopened as Paradise Theater under the ownership of brothers Ben and Lou Cohen, but direction of Black businessmen including "Andrew Sneed, Everett Watson, John Roxborough, and Irving Roane" (Nailhead). The Theater thrived in the jazz and rhythm and blues scenes in Detroit. The location regularly hosted Black entertainers and enjoyed a successful yet brief run from 1941 to 1951. The club quickly gained notoriety, and attracted famous artists such as: Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie, Duke Ellington (Zlatopolsky, 2015).
            </p>

            <p>
               The club became a crucial development hub for jazz, bebop, blues, and other popular music genres. Although it was forced to close in 1951, the musical connections and genre experimentation that took place in the club were significant contributions to the development of popular music and jazz. The venue is once again home to the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The location and venue is often the source of a contested debate regarding the boundaries of Paradise Valley.

                One of the last standing bulidings in Paradise Valley, 606 Horseshoe Lounge featured musicians such as Duke Ellington, Dinah Washington, Ink Spots and Sarah Vaughan.

            <h2>Flame Show Bar</h2>
            <p>
                Opened in 1949 by Morris Wasserman, the Flame Show Bar was known as “Little Las Vegas,” and situated on John R Street or Paradise Valley's "street of music" (Peters,  2020, p.25). Though white-owned, the Flame Show Bar contributed greatly to the introduction of large Black performers to the Paradise Valley business district. The Flame Show Bar hosted music legends such as Billie Holiday, Della Reese, Etta James, Dinah Washington, B.B. King, and Joe Turner (McGonigal, 2015). Notably, Detroit music legend, Maurice King, directed the resident band at the Bar which became the iconic band for Motown Records. The bar eventually closed in 1963.
